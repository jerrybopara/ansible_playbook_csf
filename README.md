# Ansible + Playbook + CSF + Alias 

## *Agenda*

### 1. I wanted to have a solution, where i simply run a small command and my ip address is got `WHITELISTED` on all the remote servers. 
	   - I've many Servers and I used to access them from my remote locations. Even my team access them remotely but we all having dynamic ip's

	   - So it becomes a reapting task for me to `WHITELIST` the Ip's. 
### 2.
