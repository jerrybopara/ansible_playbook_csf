# Ansible + Playbook + CSF + Alias 

## *Agenda*

#### - I wanted to have a solution, where i simply `WHITELIST` Ip addresses with single command on multiple remote server's CSF at Once.  

#### - I've many Servers and I used to access them from my remote locations. 
	   Even my team access them remotely but we all having dynamic ip's.

#### - So it becomes a reapting task for everyone to have their ip's `WHITELISTED`.
