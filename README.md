# Ansible + Playbook + CSF + Alias 

## *Agenda*

#### - I wanted to have a solution, where i simply `WHITELIST` Ip addresses with single command on multiple remote server's CSF at Once.  

#### - I've many Servers and I use to access them from my remote locations. Even my team access them remotely but we all having dynamic ip's.

#### - So it became a repeating task for everyone to have their ip's `WHITELISTED`. 
#### - I thought to create a small ansible playbook and reduce the repeating work. 


## *Let's Begin -*
